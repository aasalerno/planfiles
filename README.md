# planfiles
Here is where I'll keep my "plan files", an annotated version of my lab notes where I state what I did each day. Each file name is anths_plan_YYYYMMDD.txt

The point of this repository is to clone what John Carmack, former lead developer for id Software, current lead developer of Oculus Rift. He would make these plan files on a daily basis to inform his players what was happening in the world of Doom and Quake (and now OR) based on what he's doing and fixing. They were meant to be short, sweet, and to the point -- think of it as  a twitter for what he did that day.

In order to ensure that I keep on task and have a steady log to note what I'm doing and what I plan to do -- in addition to how successful I am that day, I should have a better chance of being able to complete my M. Sc. quickly.
