To do:

1) Fix Jon's letter -- 500 word limit
2) Edit my experience profile to include SciX - remove DJing
3) Test phase corrections on all brains (potentially do tomorrow)
4) Run undersampled dti scan at around 1
5) Look into python gui potential

Done:
1) Fixed -- exactly 500 words. Sent to Jon
2) Done -- should get Elisa to edit. To me it seems that it isn't due until the 19th...
3) Data running providing all images.
4) Running. 7min 11sec per undersampled fid. ~30 min per fully sampled fid
5) Seems to be working okay -- need to fiddle with this more
