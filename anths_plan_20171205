To do
1) Try to figure out where the data is supposed to be for the undersampled dataset...
2) Look into how the phase correction data is being applied ot the US data (the fully sampled b0s dont even look that good... - could be due to where they are in the image, though)
3) Fix up how the undersampled data is pre-processed. Look into the best method to newly determine the sampling mask from the values within the PE table --> how do they align now (due to shifts and whatnot -- necessary for applying data sharing)
4) If we can get all that done, apply pre-processing to all data, and write to numpy files (may split by slice in the readout after RO fft) to be reconstructed by the CS algorithm. 
5) Edit essay again after getting it back from Ashkan -- edited in the morning, if AA gets it back to us by tonight, otherwise final edits tomorrow.

Done:
1) Applied shifts -- looks like the FOV shifts should be applied without the phase_ramp, but it also seems like the phase ramp isn't particularly doing much...
2) Data still looks a bit fuzzy and I'm not quite sure why...
