To do
1) Try to figure out where the data is supposed to be for the undersampled dataset...
2) Look into how the pohase correction data is being applied (the fully sampled b0s dont even look that good... - could be due to where they are in the image, though)
3) Fix up how the undersampled data is pre-processed. Look into the best method to newly determine the sampling mask (due to shifts and whatnot -- necessary for applying data sharing)
4) If we can get all that done, apply pre-processing to all data, and write to numpy files (may split by slice in the readout after RO fft) to be reconstructed by the CS algorithm.
