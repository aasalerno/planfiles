To do:

1) 	a) Go through the phase correction code and apply the code in the "k-space projection" method
	b) If that works, apply it to a bunch of different coils and directions for testing purposes -- recall that when applying this, all we really care about is kTmod and imTmod -- the ones that it came from, one will look good, the other will not. 
2) Go through the comspy code and ensure that the TV and the gTV have the directional part attached for use
3) Try to figure out what's happening with the Bruker with Lily -- get a flowmeter from the Agilent setup
4) Add up hours for York U secondary and submit it!

Done:
1) a) This is fast -- AND SEEMS TO WORK!
   b) Seems to be a big issue with the data -- don't know where it's centered!
2) Was already done! Should work on the fly already. Can't test as phase corrections still having issues. :'(
3) Couldn't find a flowmeter with the proper connectors...
4) Submitted.
