To do:

1) Begin writing about different phase corrections that need to be applied
	a) Reason as to why --> from Fourier Transform properties 
	b) All of the different phase corrections that are necessary
	c) Ask Brian/Leigh exactly how their RARE phase correction works
2) Meeting with Brian
	a) Try to finish the RARE Phase Correction
3) Read "Wine" by Lessing


Done:

1) Writing about phase corrections
	a) Fourier Transform property inserted -- along with explination
	b) All different corrections listed -- NOT FULLY EXPLAINED YET
	c) Not Completed.
2) Done.
	a) Issue with GROF in the phase correction data. Reacquiring on 11/22/2017
3) Read. It's an odd one.
