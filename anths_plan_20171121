To do:

1) Begin writing about different phase corrections that need to be applied
	a) Reason as to why --> from Fourier Transform properties
	b) All of the different phase corrections that are necessary
	c) Ask Brian/Leigh exactly how their RARE phase correction works
2) Meeting with Brian
	a) Try to finish the RARE Phase Correction
	b) Chat about simplicity of moving the US acquisitions to the Bruker
	c) Chat about US in EPI?
3) Read "Wine" by Lessing
