* Test least_Squares_Fitting function with a small "directional data" sample. Compare to MATLAB
* Prepare a checklist/notes for Wednesday's meeting, and do "dry-runs"
	** Possibly make an HTML file for going through the code like RStudio?
* Attend JC
* Time permitting: Input proper XFM gradient
* Rewrite wavelet method math for discussion tomorrow

+ Tested lsq fit -- built on basis of MATLAB code
	+ Commit: aeaab25da61af49df245f634cfe2bbffbb0a2ec9
- Checklist and notes are planned for tomorrow
+ Attended JC
- XFM Gradient applicaton requires discussion with Brian about how it will be done. We don't have matrix methods for the wavelets, only coefficients
