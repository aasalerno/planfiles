Plans
* Fix undersampling scheme for cyl. acquisition
* Work on diffusion direction codes -- ensure that values are the same between MATLAB and Python
* Check "middle matrix" (M) values for diffusion direction comparison

+ Undersampling scheme for cyl. acquisition fixed
+ Added in zero-padding ability if acqSize != 2^N 
	- Would resampling work better?
+ Directional sampling is now fully functional from start to finish
	- Edited order of dimensions -- standard is now [diff, spatial, spatial] for one slice
