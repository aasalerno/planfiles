Need to start doing this again for personal work. Need to keep on top of it to ensure that I will be successful in my M.Sc.

Plans
  * Test gradients for all functions, currently with the exception of the directional term of the TV [TVdir]
  * Recode TVdir to work with the scipy lsq function
    --- As an aside to this, test how long it takes in comparison to the current method, and see if there is a way to pass the "middle" matrix, as we do...
  * Read more on the different functions that we can use for the optimization as found:
    http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#stochasticgradientdescent
  
  + Seems like there are some issues with either the gradients or how I'm testing them
    ~ I'm using (f(x+h)-f(x-h))/2h to calculate the numerical derivative at a certain point (note that the direction that im looking at is [1,1,...,1]' as I'm merely adding h to the function, as it should be fine with any direction that is calculated
  - Haven't been able to do this -- the recoding will be done tomorrow
  + Lightly read this, may look into it more after talking to Brian more about it...
