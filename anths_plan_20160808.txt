* Ensure the TV and XFM operators work for 3D data sets
* Calculate M matrices for each direction, test against MATLAB
* Check fit solutions for a simple 30 "direction"  case, compare against MATLAB
* Read JC paper for tomorrow

+ Checked to ensure that the TV operator works for 3D data (tested 3D spatial) and works well. Best method for XFM would be *external* loop for speed (i.e. not doing logical checks each time)

+ Edited bits of code, M matricies are now identical to MATLAB
	- Two issues: 1) Working with directions, best way to handle differences -- should we use the "closer" of the vectors (i.e. dir vs -dir as done in the sampling algorithm)
		      2) May need to pass more args through after, currently only passing M, but r and inds may be required

+ Fit solutions work as expected. Need to test with the entire code as a whole, but the module works as expected
