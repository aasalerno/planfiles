To do:

1) Fill magnet with N2 and read off Bruker data for magnet log
2) MR Meeting at 11 -- discuss connectors and plan for tomorrow on Bruker wrt dying mice -- flow of scavenging tube
3) Look into coils that are "jumpy" downstairs
4) Run and test phase correction code on fully sampled 120 direction data 
5) Read in undersampled data -- go over PC w Brian?
6) Finish Teachers College Application


Done:

1) Magnet filling as of 9:30. Bruker data will be read around 10:30. Both complete as of 10:36
2) During meeting we noted that I have to fix some jumpiness issues with some of the coils in the basket and analyze flow tomorrow with Lily on the Bruker.
3) Fixed. Main issue was them being offset from their central capacitence locations
4) - Noticed a bug in the 120 direction data collection scheme -- there was a -1 in a mapping that already took place via the list. Corrected.
   - Also seem to have banding issues. in the data. The post PC corrections don't look as good as I would have hoped.
4) Didn't get to do this but we went through some more PC analysis
5) Maybe do this when I get home -- have to figure out how they want me to calculate the hours...
