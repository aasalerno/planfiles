To do:

1) Read Leigh's paper
2) Go through the codes to ensure I get exactly how the phase are being applied
3) Implement the proper phase calculations into the data consistency objective function and its gradient -- need to make sure that it's applied correctly though, as it's a bit of an odd system to apply it -- this could be done via the phase being in one array, laid out based on how the data should be 
4) Start on the "what to do for my thesis" list.

Done:
1) Read it enough -- will cite
2) I think I get it - I don't think I need to actually do a double phase calculation, why would we push it towards this bad solution...
3) See above
4) Done.
